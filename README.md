This is an example [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project consuming Shopify App Bridge Session Tokens for authentication using utilities from [shopify-nextjs-toolbox](https://github.com/ctrlaltdylan/shopify-nextjs-toolbox)

## Getting Started

First, set your Shopify App's public & private keys in `.env.local`

```
SHOPIFY_API_PUBLIC_KEY='your public api key from the Shopify app dashboard here'
SHOPIFY_API_PRIVATE_KEY='your private api key from the Shopify app dashboard here'
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_API_PUBLIC_KEY='same value as SHOPIFY_API_PUBLIC_KEY, this will expose your public key to the frontend'
SHOPIFY_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL='<your-sub-domain>.ngrok.io/api/auth/callback'
SHOPIFY_AUTH_SCOPES='read_customers,write_customers' # a comma separated list of Shopify Auth scopes your app requires to function
HOME_PATH = '/home' # or wherever you'd like the user to be sent to after successfully authenticating
```

Then make sure your app is configured to use `<your-sub-domain>.ngrok.io` as the entry point.

Second, start up [ngrok](https://ngrok.io) and configure it to use `localhost:3000`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## How it works

This example app is using a set of utilities from the [shopify-nextjs-toolbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shopify-nextjs-toolbox) to handle Shopify's OAuth handshake and cookie-less session token generation & verification.

### OAuth Handshake

When a customer opens your app, they will be directed to your app's defined homepage in your Shopify App settings.

In `_app.js` use the `ShopifyAppBridgeProvider` component to check for authentication, and begin the OAuth process if a customer isn't logged in:

```javascript
// pages/_app.js

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // The ShopifyAppBridgeProvider abstracts starting the OAuth process
  //   it will automatically redirect unauthenticated users to your `/api/auth.js` route
  return (
    <ShopifyAppBridgeProvider Component={Component} pageProps={pageProps}>
      <AppProvider i18n={enTranslations}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </AppProvider>
    </ShopifyAppBridgeProvider>
  );
}
```

The OAuth flow begins at `/api/auth.js`. It will redirect to Shopify's authorization page. No need to do anything else besides export the built in middleware:

```javascript
// pages/api/auth.js

import { handleAuthStart } from "shopify-nextjs-toolbox";

export default handleAuthStart;
```

After the user accepts your app's scopes and terms, they will be redirected from Shopify to `/api/auth/callback.js`.

That route will then verify the signature of the request and retrieve the merchant's Shopify access token.

The `afterAuth` function is called after the access token is successfully retrieved. Create your own `afterAuth` to store the shop's access token which is passed as the third argument `sessionToken`:

```javascript
// pages/api/auth/callback.js
import { handleAuthCallback } from "shopify-nextjs-toolbox";

const afterAuth = async (req, res, accessToken) => {
  // save accessToken with the shop
  db.collection("shop").insertOne({ name: req.query.shop, accessToken });

  // redirect is handled by handleAuthCallback, no need to res.send() or res.redirect() here.
};

export default handleAuthCallback(afterAuth);
```

Now that the merchant's OAuth handshake is complete, the customer is finally redirected to `/pages/home.js`, or whichever path you provide in `process.env.HOME_PATH`. This route is an internal route. Meaning, it can assume that the Shopify AppBridge has a valid `shopDomain` query parameter, and the merchant is authenticated by OAuth.

### App Bridge Session Token Retrieval

After the handshake is complete, in the `_app.js` the App Bridge is instantiated and the session token is retrieved. The host is transferred to your app by Shopify through the query param `host={host}`.

The `pages/home.js` is not rendered until the session token is available for consumption.

Once the page loads, then an HTTP request with the session token is sent to `/api/verify-token.js` where it's decoded and validated with your app's private key.

## TODO

- Implement a client side redirecting scheme to detect unauthorized use and return the user back to the oauth flow.
  - For example: https://github.com/Shopify/koa-shopify-auth/blob/master/src/auth/redirection-page.ts
